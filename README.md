# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM ðŸ˜Ž

This project aims to predict the stock prices of TESLA using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that is well-suited for sequence prediction tasks like time series forecasting.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains the stock prices of TESLA for the period from September 29, 2021, to September 29, 2022. It includes various features such as the opening price, closing price, low price, etc. 

## Requirements

To run the code in this project, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

```
pip install jupyter tensorflow pandas numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the project files.

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `Stock_Prediction_LSTM.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook:

```
jupyter notebook Stock_Prediction_LSTM.ipynb
```

4. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to train the LSTM model and predict the stock prices.

## Note

- Ensure that you have downloaded the dataset and placed it in the appropriate directory as specified in the notebook.
- This project is for educational and experimental purposes only. The predictions made by the LSTM model may not always be accurate, and real-world stock market behavior can be highly unpredictable.
